# Inquirer App

This program uses command line interface (CLI) to take input in from the use and generate a simple, 
thorough README.md file with a table of contents, badges, and sections on usage, installation, and more. 

To complete this project, I further developed my skills using javascript, node.js, and CLI input and dependencies.

Let's take a quick tour of how to use the app.

First, use Node.js to execute the file:

From there, the program uses inquirer to gather input from the user in the bash terminal. Users
give input, question by question, to generate the content for the readme file.

And from there, once the user has input all of their data and selected a licence, the file is automatically generated. 

The responses are logged in the console so the user can double check their work, and a success message is 
displayed letting them know their readme file is complete.
